# OpenAPI Client

Generate ES6 or Typescript service integration code from an OpenAPI 2.0 spec.

Also supports optional Redux action creator generation.

This is a fork from the original [https://github.com/mikestead/openapi-client](https://github.com/mikestead/openapi-client) in order to generate redux and actions with camel case names.

Also support AbortController to cancel inflight requests. 

Check the original author code for more details.
